# Warm-Up

```{css}
code.sourceCode {
  font-size: 1.4em;
}

div.cell-output-stdout {
  font-size: 1.4em;
}
```

I don't think we'll need a warm up today!\
If anyone brought a problem, let me know and we cover it next time.

## Ulkar's Data

What is the content of the four files we have? What do we need to know about the paradigm and data? What do all the variables/columns stand for?

-   expactacy_ratings.txt

    -   

-   PIT-Transfer-only.txt

-   pit-transfer-all.txt

-   learning.txt

Read in and inspect data:

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse) 

expectancy_ratings <- read_delim("Data/expactacy_ratings.txt", delim = "\t")
transfer <- read_delim("Data/PIT-Transfer-only.txt", delim = "\t")
transfer_all <- read_delim("Data/pit-transfer-all.txt", delim = "\t")
learning <- read_delim("Data/learning.txt", delim = "\t")

glimpse(expectancy_ratings)
unique(expectancy_ratings$Subject)
```

## What do we want to visualize?

## Further Data Wrangling?

## DataViz

## Next Meeting?

When?

What should we cover?

Basic stats (how basic?), functions, R Projects, writing reports..?
