# Problem: Dependent Measures

Often in our research, we have repeated measures: We collect more than one data point from each subject.

Advantage: increased power and precision.\
Disadvantage: violates **iid** (independent and identically distributed) assumption of *ordinary least squares* methods (regression, ANOVA).

-   independent: probability of a data point taking on specific value is independent of of values taken by other data points.

-   identically distributed: data points are samples from same underlying distribution.

Problem: Observations from the same subject are usually correlated (i.e. more likely to be similar to each other than to other observations).

--\> this also applies to other forms of dependency: if units of observations are clustered, e.g. mice in cage/handled by experimenter, students in classroom...

. . .

In contrast to violations of other assumptions (normality, homoscadicity), ANOVA is not robust against this violation! â€“\> increased type 1 error/false positives

## Repeated Measures ANOVA

## Mixed ANOVA

## Linear Mixed Effects Models

-   generalization of OLS, captures dependency explicitly in *random effects parameters*.

    -   provide accurate and generalizable estimated of these effects, improved power, non-inflated type 1 errors.
