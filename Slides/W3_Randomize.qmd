# Some general notes

-   You can write everything on one line, but I usually add line breaks to increase readability

# Randomization vs. Counterbalancing

*Randomization/random assignment*: Determining completely at random (or pseudorandom) e.g. which condition a participant belongs to/which stimulus is shown... (Block randomization = all conditions occur once before being repeated.)

*Counterbalancing*: Determining how many conditions etc. there are and making sure that all orders are seen by the same number of participants. (This term is often used for within-subjects designs!)

::: notes
Problem Random: unequal sample sizes (not a problem for LMMs, but should be roughly equal to have good power)

Counterbalanced Randomization: Make list and randomly assign participants to which list to use.
:::

## Let's dive in with an example

We have three conditions (between-subject) and we want to randomly assign each participant to a condition.

. . .

We would use a function called `sample()`, which will be our best friend for today:\
It allows us to draw from a vector (think of drawing a paper slip from a hat), either with or without replacement.

```{r}
#| echo: true
# good practice to set a seed to make the (pseudo-)randomization reproducible 
set.seed(123)

# just shuffle
# you could also use this to create different stimulus-lists!
conds <- sample(c("condition A", "condition B", "condition C"))
conds

# draw them repeatedly (with equal probability)
conds2 <- sample(c("condition A", "condition B", "condition C"), 30, replace = TRUE)
conds2
table(conds2)

```

. . .

The latter would be \~ random assignment. If we want equal group sizes, we could use a vector of length = sample size and shuffle it (sample without replacement):

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
conds <- sample(rep(c("condition A", "condition B", "condition C"), times=10))
conds
table(conds)
```

Add to dataframe:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)

design <- tibble(
  ID = 1:30,
  cond = sample(rep(c("condition A", "condition B", "condition C"), times=10))
)

```

## Two conditions

We can draw them separately:

```{r}
#| echo: true


treatment <- c("Treatment", "Control")
color <- c("blue", "yellow")

design <- tibble(
  ID = 1:40,
  cond = sample(rep(treatment, times=20)),
  color = sample(rep(color, times=20))
)

table(design$cond, design$color) 

# make sure each combination is equally often represented:
design <- crossing(treatment, color) %>% # gets all combinations
  mutate(combi=str_c(treatment, color, sep="_")) %>%  # combine columns
  select(-treatment, -color) %>%   # remove original ones
  reframe(combi2 = sample(rep(combi, 10))) %>%  # use reframe to add rows
  mutate(ID = 1:n()) %>%  # add participant number
  separate_wider_delim(combi2, delim="_", names=c("treatment", "color"))

table(design$treatment, design$color)
```

## Draw from a probability distribution

Sometimes it can be helpful to draw a random number from a certain probability distribution, e.g. if you want to get Inter-Trial-Intervals from a normal or uniform distribution or if you want to simulate a coin toss with a binomial distribution.

In R, you can use certain functions that start with an "r" (e.g. `rnorm()`, `runif()`, `rbinom()`) to draw random numbers from distributions.

. . .

Let's start with the coin toss, as it is similar to using `sample()`. The binomial distribution gives you the "successes" (vs. failure, so 1 vs. 0 or heads vs. tails) in a row of "experiments" (coin tosses).

You could of course determine the condition by "tossing a coin". The "problem" is that the count of each outcome will be different for each participant.

```{r}
#| echo: true

# repeat a study 10 times in which 100 fair coins are tossed -out of the 100, how often do we get heads?
rbinom(10,100,.5) 

# For one participant, determine whether 10 trials are condition 0 or 1 (with 60% probability for cond. 1)
rbinom(10,1,.6)
```

. . .

Let's draw 10 jittered ITIs from a normal distribution: We want them to be jittered around a mean of 1500 msec with a SD of 200 msec:

```{r}
#| echo: true

rnorm(10, mean = 1500, sd = 200)

# you could also round them:
round(rnorm(10, 1500, 200), 0)
```

You could use the uniform distribution if you want each number to be equally likely:

```{r}
#| echo: true
# get 10 numbers between 1200 and 1800 msec
round(runif(10, min = 1200, max = 1800), 0)

```

## Any other questions?

Specific to your design etc.?

## Ecem's study - detour incl. loops and if-statements!

-   Shape (4x) and color (4x)

-   each participant (N=~~16~~ 4) should have four stimuli assigned, each color and each shape once

-   but each of the stimuli should be used equally often!

```{r}
#| echo: true
shape <- c("s1", "s2", "s3", "s4")
color <- c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4")

crossing(shape, color)  # 16 combinations
```

If we simply draw from this list, a participant likely has a shape/color twice. If we draw from both lists separately, we can't make sure that another participant won't get the same combination! (If we just draw stimuli completely at random, this would be fine...)

. . .

We could "brute-force" it: Draw a stimulus and compare it to the already drawn ones. If already included, draw next one etc.

```{r}
#| echo: true
# participant 1
stimlist1 <- tibble(
  ID = 1, 
  stim_shape = sample(shape),
  stim_col = sample(color)
) %>% 
  mutate(combi=str_c(stim_shape, stim_col, sep="_"))   # combine columns
  
# participant 2
stimlist2 <- tibble(
  ID = 2, 
  stim_shape = sample(shape),
  stim_col = sample(color)
) %>% 
  mutate(combi=str_c(stim_shape, stim_col, sep="_"))   # combine columns

# check whether stimuli are the same in both stimlists
# you could use %in% (not "==" -> would only check rowwise!) or setdiff()

stimlist1$combi %in% stimlist2$combi # checks whether any of stimlist 2 is in stimlist 1 -> should be 4x FALSE
setdiff(stimlist2$combi, stimlist1$combi) # gives you the ones that are different in stimlist2 -> should be 4

any(stimlist1$combi %in% stimlist2$combi) # test whether any of the 4 is TRUE
```

### Run repeatedly until "novel" list is found

We will use a `while statement`[^1] in combination with an `if statement` for this!

[^1]: Rarely used in tidyverse, but often used in base R/other programming languages!

The `while statement` will run the code until the condition in the if statement is met and then break out of the while loop.

The `if statement` tests a condition. Only if the condition is met, the code underneath is carried out. It is also possible to use alternative conditions: `if(...) {...} elseif() {...} else {...}`

```{r}
#| echo: true
# check repeatedly
while(TRUE) {
  stimlist2 <- tibble(
  ID = 2, 
  stim_shape = sample(shape),
  stim_col = sample(color)
) %>% 
  mutate(combi=str_c(stim_shape, stim_col, sep="_"))   # combine columns
  
  if(!any(stimlist1$combi %in% stimlist2$combi)){
    break;
  }
}

# we could also use:
# test <- TRUE
# while(test == TRUE) {
#   ...
#   if(...)
#     test <- FALSE}
```

## Repeat for more participants

We could copy the code for every participant, but this would be tedious and would result in a long script. Alternatively, we can use a `for-loop`! It is similar to the while statement and runs the included code a specified number of times:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# initiate variables and dataframes (fill in with values later)
n <- 4 # easily change number of subjects here - max 4 possible w/16 combis!
shape <- c("heart", "sacral", "throat", "solar") # or "s1" etc
color <- c("yellow", "purple", "orange", "blue") # or "c1" etc

overall_stimlist <- tibble(
  ID = rep(NA, 4*n), # fill in NAs, 4 rows per participant
  stim_shape = rep(NA, 4*n),
  stim_col = rep(NA, 4*n),
  combi = rep(NA, 4*n)
)

for(i in 1:n){
  
  print(i)  # just so you know how far the loop is
  
  while(TRUE) {
  stimlist2 <- tibble(
  ID = i,   # use the index of the loop iteration!
  stim_shape = sample(shape),
  stim_col = sample(color)) %>% 
  mutate(combi=str_c(stim_shape, stim_col, sep="_"))   # combine columns
  
  if(!any(overall_stimlist$combi %in% stimlist2$combi)){
      break;
    }
  }
  
   # save to overall_stimlist at correct location
  overall_stimlist[(4*i-3):(4*i), ] <- stimlist2
  
  
  # Ecem also wants to shuffle each stimlist2 4 times to get different orders - making sure that no stimulus is in the same location!
  # we can get all permutations (using an R function like Permn()), but this would be 24 variations (incl. same stimulus in same location)
  # instead, we just manually shift the stimuli by one (e.g. 1st becomes 2nd etc.)
  
  # stimlist3 <- stimlist2[c(2,3,4,1),]
  # stimlist4 <- stimlist2[c(3,4,1,2),]
  # stimlist5 <- stimlist2[c(4,1,2,3),]
 
  
}

# add further info to the dataframe
overall_stimlist <- overall_stimlist %>% 
  mutate(
    CS_type = rep(c("threat", "safety", "amb1", "amb2"), times=n),
    percentage = rep(c(100, 0, 50, 50), times=n)
  )

```

For Ecem's study, it is more complex and she already made stimulus lists per hand! I would actually just use this list and read it into R (in a good format).

## Make the stimulus list per participant

Now that we know which stimulus is used for which category for each participant, we can generate the stimulus list. In Ecem's study, we have 2 blocks Ã  100 trials (after the first block, the stimulus type changes). Let's focus on the first block.

We have different trial types: 60 single and 40 multi cue. For the single cues, each of the 4 stimulus types is shown 15x, for the multicue, a combination of two types (threat or safety with each amb) is shown 10x. In the multi cue trials, other stimuli are also shown, which are the other combinations of shape and color.

We first simply list all possibilities and repeat them as often as needed:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
trial_list <- sample(c(  # wrap in sample()!
  rep("threat", 15),
  rep("safety", 15),
  rep("amb1", 15),
  rep("amb2", 15),
  rep("threat-amb1", 10),
  rep("threat-amb2", 10),
  rep("safety-amb1", 10),
  rep("safety-amb2", 10)
))

length(trial_list)  # make sure it's 100!
trial_list


```

What if we need a minimum distance between the same stimulus types?

TAKES LONG; DON'T RUN!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

trial_list2 <- rep(NA, length(trial_list))
trial_list2[1] <- trial_list[1] # fill in the first already to have a comparison

for (i in 2:length(trial_list)) { # start with 2!
  
  while(trial_list[i] == trial_list[i-1]) { # check for last 2: %in% trial_list[i-2:i-1]
    trial_list[i:length(trial_list)] <- sample(trial_list[i:length(trial_list)])
  } 
  trial_list2[i] <- trial_list[i]
  
}

# check whether correct
trial_list2 != lag(trial_list2) 
```

## Fill in the remaining information

...for single cue trials!

```{r}
#| echo: true

triallist_vp1 <- tibble(
  trial = 1:length(trial_list),
  block = 1,
  CS_type = trial_list # same name as in stimlist for join!
) %>% 
  
  # add info from stimlist
  left_join(overall_stimlist %>% filter(ID==1)) %>%  # change ID! = for-loop
  
  # determine whether shock or not (can also use 1 and 0)
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    trial_type = ifelse(CS_type %in% c("threat", "safety", "amb1", "amb2"), "sc", "mc"),
    shock = case_when(
      CS_type == "threat" ~ "shock", 
      CS_type == "safety" ~ "noshock",
      # CS_type %in% c("amb1", "amb2") ~ sample(c("shock","noshock"), 1, prob = c(.5,.5)))
      CS_type %in% c("amb1", "amb2") ~ rbinom(1,1,.5)))
  )

# Doesn't seem to work, always
```

Btw: This will lead to shocks being delivered not exactly 50% of the time in the amb1/2 trials â\> see above for other solution.

## Multi-cue trials?

For the multi-cue trials, we could split the name of the stimuli to two columns and do similar things as above with both columns:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# we start again with the trial_list, code from above
triallist_vp1 <- tibble(
  trial = 1:length(trial_list),
  block = 1,
  type = trial_list # DIFFERENT name as in stimlist for join! (not neccessary!)
) %>% 
  
  separate_wider_delim(type, delim="-", names=c("CS_type1", "CS_type2"), cols_remove = FALSE, too_few = "align_start") %>% 
  # last argument leads to NAs in 2nd column for SC trials
  
   # add info from stimlist
  left_join(overall_stimlist %>% filter(ID==1), by = join_by(CS_type1 == CS_type)) %>%  # change ID! = for-loop
  
  # determine whether shock or not (can also use 1 and 0)
  mutate(
    trial_type = ifelse(type %in% c("threat", "safety", "amb1", "amb2"), "sc", "mc"),
    shock1 = case_when(
      CS_type1 == "threat" ~ "shock", 
      CS_type1 == "safety" ~ "noshock",
      CS_type1 %in% c("amb1", "amb2") ~ sample(c("shock","noshock"), 1, prob = c(.5,.5))),
    shock2 = case_when(
      CS_type2 == "threat" ~ "shock", 
      CS_type2 == "safety" ~ "noshock",
      CS_type2 %in% c("amb1", "amb2") ~ sample(c("shock","noshock"), 1)))

```
