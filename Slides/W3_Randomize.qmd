# Randomization vs. Counterbalancing

*Randomization*: Determining completely at random (or pseudorandom) e.g. which condition a participant belongs to/which stimulus is shown...

*Counterbalancing*: Determining how many conditions etc. there are and making sure that all orders are seen by the same number of participants.
