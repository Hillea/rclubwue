We will start with the basics and will switch to topics that are of interest to the majority (similar to a Journal Club). In the beginning, Lea will teach, but the format may change to others presenting solutions to problems they encountered or topics they find interesting. This way, we can all learn together!\nWe meet weekly on Tuesdays, 16:00 - 18:00 in Room 213 at the Marcusstr, starting in January 2024. The syllabus can be found here. On this page, the slides etc. will be linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession\nDate\nTopic\nPreparation/Notes\n\n\n\n\n1\n9.01.24\nIntro to R & RStudio\nInstall R and RStudio\n\n\n2\n16.01.24\nData Wrangling\n\n\n\n3\n23.01.24\nData Visualization\n\n\n\n4\n30.01.24\nPreprocessing, e.g. physio data\n\n\n\n5\n06.02.24\nPreprocessing\n\n\n\n6\n13.02.24\n(are we continuing during the semester break?)\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n[1] \"Hello World\""

However, you’d better heavily comment in your scripts, so that future you (and potentially collaborators) know what happens in your script.\nAn alternative is an R Markdown file. This is also a sort of script, but you can write text (like in a word processor) and mix it with code chunks, where you can write your R code. R Markdown is the “language” you use to write in these files, which is a variety of Markdown.\nThe advantage of R Markdown files (ending with .Rmd) is that they increase reproducibility. For example, you can write whole reports in R Markdown (and also these slides are made with it!).\nA newer variant is called quarto, which works very similar (but is more flexible) to R Markdown."
