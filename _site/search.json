We will start with the basics and will switch to topics that are of interest to the majority (similar to a Journal Club). In the beginning, Lea will teach, but the format may change to others presenting solutions to problems they encountered or topics they find interesting.\nWe meet weekly on Tuesdays, 16:00 - 18:00 in Room 213 at the Marcusstr, starting in January 2024. The syllabus can be found here. On this page, the slides etc. will be linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession\nDate\nTopic\nPreparation/Notes\n\n\n\n\n1\n9.01.24\nIntro to R & RStudio\nInstall R and RStudio\n\n\n2\n16.01.24\nData Wrangling\n\n\n\n3\n23.01.24\nData Visualization\n\n\n\n4\n30.01.24\nPreprocessing, e.g. physio data\n\n\n\n5\n06.02.24\nPreprocessing\n\n\n\n6\n13.02.24\n(are we continuing during the semester break?)"
