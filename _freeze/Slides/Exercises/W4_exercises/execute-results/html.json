Feel free to google (coding is 90% googling...) or use AI as much as you want (but also think about the steps you need to take yourself...).\n\nFirst of all, possibly download (or locate) the data and **load** it into R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data into RStudio\n```\n:::\n\n\n## What can we do with this data set?\n\nCheck out the data set (and possibly the codebook), and decide what aspects (a.k.a. columns/variables) of the data would interest you (as a group!).\n\n195 columns are a lot, so maybe only **keep those columns** that are interesting for you.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# check out data\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Renaming columns\n\nThese column names might not be very helpful to remember what the names stand for. If you want to, try to **change the names** of a few of these columns!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Tidying the data\n\nIs the data in a tidy format?\n\nWhat is a tidy format? (Slides)\n\nIf not, **reshape** the data. (And if yes, reshape it anyway to practice! :D)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n(You might merge data frames at some point, possibly here, how do you da that?)\n\n## Calculating the average ratings\n\nWe might want to calculate the average of the ratings, e.g. attractiveness across time points.\n\nFirst of all, unfortunately the ratings are on different scales between waves:\n\n> Waves 6-9: Please rate the importance of the following attributes in a potential date on a scale of 1-10 (1=not at all important, 10=extremely important):\n>\n> Waves 1-5, 10-21: You have 100 points to distribute among the following attributes -- give more points to those attributes that are more important in a potential date, and fewer points to those attributes that are less important in a potential date.  Total points must equal 100.\n\n1.  **Transform** these ratings to scales that are somewhat comparable!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n1.  Now **calculate the average** ratings across time points per speed dater.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Filtering the speed daters\n\nMake a new data frame that only consists of female speed daters! Also filter out those where the partner is older than the speed dater.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Sort the data frame\n\nSort the data frame based on the correlation between the interests, from highest to lowest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Visualize!\n\n(Small Intro –\\> Visualization Slides!)\n\nNow decide - as a group - what kind of plot to make!\n\nMake this **plot**, layer by layer.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
