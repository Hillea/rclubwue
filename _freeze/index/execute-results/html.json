We will start with the basics and will switch to topics that are of interest to the majority (similar to a Journal Club). In the beginning, Lea will teach, but the format may change to others presenting solutions to problems they encountered or topics they find interesting. We may end up as a Data Dojo/Coding Club, where we work on problems together. This way, we can all learn together!\n\nWe meet weekly on Tuesdays, 16:00 - 18:00 in Room 213 at the Marcusstr, starting in January 2024. The syllabus can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJPsgPMPv_2EYwyGL7kv9Mb846iilznj3cuKNvwuINc/edit#heading=h.9xs7fuefba6l). On this page, the slides etc. will be linked.\n\n| Session | Date     | Topic                            | Preparation/Notes                                                               |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1       | 16.01.24 | Intro to R & RStudio             | [Install R and RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) |\n| 2       | 23.01.24 | Data Wrangling                   |                                                                                 |\n| 3       | 30.01.24 | Randomization & Counterbalancing | (Ecem)                                                                          |\n| 4       | 06.02.24 | Data Visualization               |                                                                                 |\n| 5       | 13.02.24 | (Semester break or continue?)    |                                                                                 |\n| 6       | 20.02.24 | Preprocessing, e.g. physio data  |                                                                                 |\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Hello World\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
